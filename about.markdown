I am Brian Davis, a web developer and general tech enthusiast. This is a low-key blog for my thoughts on tech and software development. I am mainly interested in Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL, React, and NodeJS. I may also post here about Linux, Apple, and even Windows 11/WSL2 power-user and general computing kinds of topics. Contact me directly via the GitHub profile in the footer here.
