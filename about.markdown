This is a low-key blog for my thoughts on tech and software development. I am mainly interested in Ruby, Rails, and PostgreSQL, and also dabble in React and other modern JS. I may also post here about Linux and Apple "power-user" kinds of topics. I value my privacy, and this page is not about self-promotion. I am not active on social media, not even LinkedIn, but you should be able to contact me directly via the GitHub profile in the footer here.
